python and pip install Naked ---- https://pypi.org/project/Naked/#description

first I would learn python and js since they are most common after that u should understand the basics
first if you wanted to do something like that you would make something to create an account
then join a team
then making a bot you would need to learn websockets
since that is how data gets sent to the server
the hardest part would probs be learning the coding language btw
but once u learn that u could probs do more than just make a bot
